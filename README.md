# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project

This project was completed by Marvin Meng and Wing Lau in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232,
Data Bootcamp, Spring 2018. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project.
In particular, I have:
Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own.
The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative
expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing
thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text
and the bibliography.
And I understand that:
Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester
or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.
I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for
the project and course.
Project Description
This project will study how education levels and crime rates have evolved over time at a narrow geographic level (a commute zone) within the United States – more specifically across New York City boroughs. This project will also evaluate the the possibility of policing policies implemented by NYC mayors between 2000 - present (Michael Bloomberg, Bill de Blasio) as  confounding variables in reducing crime rates. Essentially, the project aims to investigate two main questions: 
- Does education level have an impact on crime rates across New York City boroughs?
- How effective were specific policing policies in reducing crime rates, and what effect did that have on education levels across New York City boroughs?
